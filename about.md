  I am a second year biochemistry student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, who is on the premed track. I plan to pursue a career in Medicine. I am currrently  at Hometown Pharmacy, where I am an assitant to a the pharmacist. My role as an assitant ranges from tlking to physcians and nurses, and updating new RXs and billing. 
  I am currently a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) for foster kids. Also I am in the process of becoming a voluteer for Lumina Alliance, which is an organization who supports and helps survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. This year will be my second year participating in a Medical Telebrigade where we go to Honduras and help set up a pop up clinic and where the local community can use our health services at no cost for them.
